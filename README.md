# Maze-Solver

This code solves text-based mazes using an array-based stack and recursion. 


For these mazes, an "H" denotes a wall and a space character " " is an open space.

As the program progresses through the maze, each new location on the route to the exit is marked with a "*". However, if a dead-end is reached, it back-tracks to the last fork and marks each back-tracked location with a ",".
